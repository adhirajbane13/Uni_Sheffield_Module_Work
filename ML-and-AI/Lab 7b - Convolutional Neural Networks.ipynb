This is considered a breakthrough and has grabbed the attention of increasing number of researchers, practioners, and the general public. Since then, deep learning has penetrated to many research and application areas. AlexNet contained **eight layers**. In 2015, it was outperformed by a very deep CNN with **over 100 layers** from Microsoft in the ImageNet 2015 contest. It will be interesting to take a look at the image classification task and a CNN that can do the job well."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o4VprelVVGAU"},"source":["## 1.

    "## 1. Review of Autograd: Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we briefly covered **Tensor** and **Computational Graph**. We have actually used **Autograd** already. Here, we learn the basics below, a condensed and modified version of the original [PyTorch tutorial on Autograd](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-autograd-tutorial-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why differentiation is important? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because it is a key procedure in **optimisation** to find the optimial solution of a loss function. The process of learning/training aims to minimise a predefined loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How automatic differentiation is done in PyTorch?\n",
    "The PyTorch ``autograd`` package makes differentiation (almost) transparent to you by providing automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors, unless you do not want it (to save time and space). \n",
    "\n",
    "A ``torch.Tensor`` type variable has an attribute ``.requires_grad``. Setting this attribute ``True`` tracks (but not computes yet) all operations on it. After we define the forward pass, and hence the *computational graph*, we call ``.backward()`` and all the gradients will be computed automatically and accumulated into the ``.grad`` attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is made possible by the [**chain rule of differentiation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to stop automatic differentiation (e.g., because it is not needed)\n",
    "Calling method ``.detach()`` of a tensor will detach it from the computation history. We can also wrap the code block in ``with torch.no_grad():`` so all tensors in the block do not track the gradients, e.g., in the test/evaluation stage. "

    "## 2. Neurons and Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the lecture, a simple model of a biological neuron is one where it takes a weighted sum of all it's inputs before transforming it via a non-linear activation function. Historically, this activation function was a step function or more commonly the logistic sigmoid function. In this way the logistic regression model we saw last week is effectively a single neuron. Mathematically it is defined as\n",
    "$$ y_i = f \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^M W_{ij} x_j \\right) $$\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the value of neuron $i$, $f()$ is the non-linear activation function (e.g sigmoid), $w_{ij}$ is the weight connecting input $x_j$ to neuron $y_i$.\n",
    "This can be written in a vector form as\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{y} = f \\left( W \\mathbf{x} \\right) $$\n",
    "This is the case where we have a single input vector, libraries like PyTorch typically process a batch (or mini-batch) of inputs at the same time. In this case if $\\mathbf{x}$ is a 2d array shaped (Batch size, Input size) then this operation can be written as\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{y} = f \\left( \\mathbf{x} W^T \\right) $$\n",
    "where now $\\mathbf{y}$ is also a 2d array but with a shape (Batch size, Number of neurons). We have to transpose $W$ so that the shapes of the arrays are correct while mathematically to operation is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch the weighted sum is known as a fully connected **linear** layer (see the documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)). PyTorch has a submodule of the library called ``torch.nn`` that contains implementations of various common neural network operations that make building neural network models easy. You started using these in Lab 6 but let's look at chaining them together to create neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single layer of neurons are similar to what we have seen for linear and logistic regression. While these work for some situations, they are only linear models so when it comes to predicting classes or outputs which have complex non-linear relations of the inputs then we need to expand our models. We have already discussed using basis functions and design matrices to modify our input to include a non-linear basis. In artificial neural networks, we rely on connecting layers of neurons to discover these complex feature representations for us. So if we have a non-linear task that we want to solve we can instead create a stack of neuron layers, this is a specific form of neural networks known as a **feedforward neural network** (FFNN). In a FFNN the neurons only propagate information in one direction with no communication within layers. A 2 layer FFNN can be described as:\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\mathbf{h} = f_{(1)} \\left( \\mathbf{x} W^T_{(1)} \\right) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} = f_{(2)} \\left( \\mathbf{h} W^T_{(2)} \\right)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where $\\mathbf{h}$ are the values of the neurons in the intermediate layer, usually known as a hidden layer. $\\mathbf{y}$ is the values of the neurons in the final layer, which are usually known as the output neurons. When we are training the network we will usually be guiding these outputs towards a particular target. In this case we have 2 activation functions and 2 weight matrices which are describing the connection between the input and hidden layer, and then between the hidden layer and output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at implementing this using PyTorch. We will use a simple example where we have an input size of 3, 4 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output neuron."

    "Now we can create a model that has the correct number of inputs and outputs. Remember, when we are training these classifiers we generally use a `one-hot` encoded target. You can interpret this as the posterior probabilities (i.e the probability that input $x$ belongs to to class $i$) so each element of the output array will be related to $P(\\mathrm{class}=i | \\mathbf{x})$ and to make a classification we will need to find the predicted output that has the largest value. In this example we will look at using the Cross Entropy loss function for training our model. It is defined as \n",

Wile mean-squared error can be used on any time of outputs this is specifically expecting the output to be in terms of a probability. One of the best ways to convert a multi-class output into a probability is to use the softmax operation. This converts an array into a normalised probability by applying the following operation\n",

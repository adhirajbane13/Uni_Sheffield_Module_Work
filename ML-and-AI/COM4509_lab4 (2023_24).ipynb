The first is diffentiation of an inner product. By remebering that the inner product is made up of multiplication and addition, we can hope that its derivative is quite straightforward, and so it proves to be. We can start by thinking about the definition of the inner product,\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{a}^\\top\\mathbf{z} = \\sum_{i} a_i z_i,\n","$$\n","which if we were to take the derivative with respect to $z_k$ would simply return the gradient of the one term in the sum for which the derivative was non zero, that of $a_k$, so we know that\n","$$\n","\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}z_k} \\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathbf{z} = a_k\n","$$\n","and by our definition of multivariate derivatives we can simply stack all the partial derivatives of this form in a vector to obtain the result that\n","$$\n","\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}\\mathbf{z}} \\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{a}.\n","$$\n","The second rule that's required is differentiation of a 'matrix quadratic'. A scalar quadratic in $z$ with coefficient $c$ has the form $cz^2$. If $\\mathbf{z}$ is a $k\\times 1$ vector and $\\mathbf{C}$ is a $k \\times k$ *matrix* of coefficients then the matrix quadratic form is written as $\\mathbf{z}^\\top \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{z}$, which is itself a *scalar* quantity, but it is a function of a *vector*.\n","\n","#### Matching Dimensions in Matrix Multiplications\n","\n","There's a trick for telling that it's a scalar result. When you are doing maths with matrices, it's always worth pausing to perform a quick sanity check on the dimensions. Matrix multplication only works when the dimensions match. To be precise, the 'inner' dimension of the matrix must match. What is the inner dimension. If we multiply two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, the first of which has $k$ rows and $\\ell$ columns and the second of which has $p$ rows and $q$ columns, then we can check whether the multiplication works by writing the dimensionalities next to each other,\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B} \\rightarrow (k \\times \\underbrace{\\ell)(p}_\\text{inner dimensions} \\times q) \\rightarrow (k\\times q).\n","$$\n","The inner dimensions are the two inside dimensions, $\\ell$ and $p$. The multiplication will only work if $\\ell=p$. The result of the multiplication will then be a $k\\times q$ matrix: this dimensionality comes from the 'outer dimensions'. Note that matrix multiplication is not [*commutative*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property). And if you change the order of the multiplication,\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow (\\ell \\times \\underbrace{k)(q}_\\text{inner dimensions} \\times p) \\rightarrow (\\ell \\times p).\n","$$\n","firstly it may no longer even work, because now the condition is that $k=q$, and secondly the result could be of a different dimensionality. An exception is if the matrices are square matrices (e.g. same number of rows as columns) and they are both *symmetric*. A symmetric matrix is one for which $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}^\\top$, or equivalently, $a_{i,j} = a_{j,i}$ for all $i$ and $j$.  \n","\n","You will need to get used to working with matrices and vectors applying and developing new machine learning techniques. You should have come across them before, but you may not have used them as extensively as we will now do in this course. You should get used to using this trick to check your work and ensure you know what the dimension of an output matrix should be. For our matrix quadratic form, it turns out that we can see it as a special type of inner product.\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{z}^\\top\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{z} \\rightarrow (1\\times \\underbrace{k) (k}_\\text{inner dimensions}\\times k) (k\\times 1) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{b}^\\top\\mathbf{z}\n","$$\n","where $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{z}$ so therefore the result is a scalar,\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{b}^\\top\\mathbf{z} \\rightarrow (1\\times \\underbrace{k) (k}_\\text{inner dimensions}\\times 1) \\rightarrow (1\\times 1)\n","$$\n","where a $(1\\times 1)$ matrix is recognised as a scalar.\n","\n","This implies that we should be able to differentiate this form, and indeed the rule for its differentiation is slightly more complex than the inner product, but still quite simple,\n","$$\n","\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}\\mathbf{z}} \\mathbf{z}^\\top\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{z}= \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{z} + \\mathbf{C}^\\top \\mathbf{z}.\n","$$\n","Note that in the special case where $\\mathbf{C}$ is symmetric then we have $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{C}^\\top$ and the derivative simplifies to\n","$$\n","\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}\\mathbf{z}} \\mathbf{z}^\\top\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{z}= 2\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{z}.\n","$$\n","### Differentiating the Objective\n","\n","First, we need to compute the full objective by substituting our prediction function into the objective function to obtain the objective in terms of $\\mathbf{w}$. Doing this we obtain\n","$$\n","E(\\mathbf{w})= (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w})^\\top (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}).\n","$$\n","We now need to differentiate this *quadratic form* to find the minimum. We differentiate with respect to the *vector* $\\mathbf{w}$. But before we do that, we'll expand the brackets in the quadratic form to obtain a series of scalar terms. The rules for bracket expansion across the vectors are similar to those for the scalar system giving,\n","$$\n","(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b})^\\top (\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{d}) = \\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathbf{d} - \\mathbf{b}^\\top \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{b}^\\top \\mathbf{d}\n","$$\n","which substituting for $\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{y}$ and $\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}$ gives\n","$$\n","E(\\mathbf{w})= \\mathbf{y}^\\top\\mathbf{y} - 2\\mathbf{y}^\\top\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w}^\\top\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}\n","$$\n","where we used the fact that $\\mathbf{y}^\\top\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}= \\mathbf{w}^\\top\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\mathbf{y}$.

Now, we are going to consider how we can perform *non-linear* regression. However, before we get into the details of how to do that we first need to consider in what ways the regression can be non-linear.\n","\n","Multivariate linear regression allows us to build models that take many features into account when making our prediction. In this session we are going to introduce *basis functions*. The term seems complicated, but they are actually based on rather a simple idea. If we are doing a multivariate linear regression, we get extra features (like the body count, year, etc) that *might* help us predict our required response variable (or target value), $y$. But what if we only have one input value? We can actually artificially generate more input values with basis functions.\n","\n","### Non-linear in the Inputs\n","\n","When we refer to non-linear regression, we are normally referring to whether the regression is non-linear in the input space, or non-linear in the *covariates*. The covariates are the observations that move with the target (or *response*) variable. In our notation we have been using $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to represent a vector of the covariates associated with the $i$th observation. The coresponding response variable is $y_i$. If a model is non-linear in the inputs, it means that there is a non-linear function between the inputs and the response variable. Linear functions are functions that only involve multiplication and addition, in other words they can be represented through *linear algebra*. Linear regression involves assuming that a function takes the form\n","$$\n","f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}\n","$$\n","where $\\mathbf{w}$ are our regression weights. A very easy way to make the linear regression non-linear is to introduce non-linear functions.
